        <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
        
        <p>Homemade pizza is a culinary delight that starts with a perfect 
            dough, rolled out and topped with a flavorful tomato sauce. The 
            dough serves as a canvas for an array of toppings, from gooey 
            melted cheese to savory meats, fresh vegetables, and aromatic herbs.
            Baked to golden perfection in a hot oven, it emerges with a crispy 
            crust and bubbling cheese, ready to be enjoyed by friends 
            and family alike.</p>

        <h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Make the dough: Dissolve yeast in lukewarm water in a small 
                bowl. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, shortening, and salt in a large bowl; 
                add yeast mixture and stir until dough comes together. 
                Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth 
                and elastic, about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Lightly oil a large bowl. Place dough into the bowl and turn to 
                coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm 
                place until doubled in volume, about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make the sauce: Heat oil in a small saucepan over 
                medium heat. Add onion and sauté until tender, 
                about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in tomato paste, water, salt, sugar, oregano, garlic 
                powder, basil, marjoram, cumin, chili powder, red pepper flakes,
                 nd black pepper; simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Divide dough in half. Roll each half into a 12-inch circle. 
                Place dough onto two 12-inch pizza pans; cover with 
                sauce and mozzarella cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are golden brown, 
                about 20 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
